# Side Notes
This repo contains a bunch of notes taken for the Cryptography course by 
[blazef104](https://github.com/blazef104), [project2100](https://github.com/Project2100) and me during Fall 2018.

Please note that these notes were **our personal interpretation** of what the
professor said / what we were able to write during lectures , so they
could be full of potential errors.
**Don't take this as the Holy Bible**.

## Improve it

For improving/modifying something, you can:
* contact us/me directly (here, over Telegram or via mail), or
* you can directly open a pull request (and do it yourself). 

## Latex 
Notes are written in rough dirty Latex. 
**Since I'm not a Latex pro**, there could be __horrible things__ typed over there.
If you don't like something, change it directly or tell me and wait, or close
your eyes and try to forgive me.

The macro.tex file is taken from [asmeikal's page](https://github.com/asmeikal/crypto16/tree/master/notes) (thanks Michelle for this).

### Major issues
* ~~properly numbering chapters , section and subsections~~
* pairing theorems/claims/facts/exercises with Proofs unequivocally
* write last few lectures, left blank
### Minor issues
* refs should have a certain name while pointing to sections with other names
* could be useful to have an acronym table
