# PLEASE READ ME, before anything else
This repo contains a bunch of notes taken for the Cryptography course by 
[blazef104](https://github.com/blazef104), [project2100](https://github.com/Project2100) and me during Fall 2018.


Please note that these notes were **our personal interpretation** of what the
professor said / what we were able to write during lectures , so they
could be full of potential errors.
**Don't take this as the Holy Bible**.

Furthermore, it's my opinion that the best way to understand what is written here is to 
**challenge hard yourself** by:
* going to each lecture
* following and trying to understand LIVE proofs and concepts written on the blackboard
* checking LIVE if something wrong has been written in the notes
* filling borders of each page with your intuitions or ideas about the current argument
* coming back home/to the library and use notes to double check your knowledge or that of your colleagues.

I think if you stoically follow this algorithm, you won't waste your time at all.



## To the near future ( From Gen 2019 on )
My intention is not to destroy the content we wrote and uploaded here. Instead, since it is improvable, 
if someone else wants to add or change or delete something , or enhance the quality of one or more 
lectures in general, I will be glad to help and contribute (even if I won't attend lectures 
in the future, I still like to play with the math behind these protocols every now and then).



## To a distant future ( Beyond 2099 )
Even if Github's user policy didn't turn **malicious** taking suddenly possession of 
uploaded content's copyright or the world didn't experience World War 5 , Alien invasion
or even someone seeing John Cena yet,  these notes still would be kinda outdated, since 
you guys would be visiting this page on your 2-years-ago-bought **QUANTUM APPLE** . 
In this case, please go surf towards something more up-to-date.

## How to participate

For improving/modifying something you can:
* contact us/me directly (here, in class, over Telegram or via mail), or
* you can directly open a pull request (and do it yourself). 

## Latex 
Notes are written in Latex. 
**Since I'm not a Latex pro**, there could be __horrible things__ typed over there.
If you don't like something, change it directly or tell me and wait, or close
your eyes and try to forgive me.

The macro.tex file is taken from [asmeikal's page](https://github.com/asmeikal/crypto16/tree/master/notes) (thanks Michele for this).

**IMPORTANT**
In order to compile these notes yourself, you have to reproduce an environment similar to what we created.
The step could be pretty tough , but remember, Latex is just a programming language, so  
*patience + google + logs* 
is what you need.

### Notes schema
As you can see, I tried to split arguments __lecture by lecture__ , merging together arguments explained over 
different lectures for the sake of clarity.
I tried also to be as accurate as possible in drawing pictures.

If you don't like something, please contact me so we can try to improve it.

### Major issues
* ~~properly numbering chapters , section and subsections~~
* pairing theorems/claims/facts/exercises with Proofs unequivocally
* write last few lectures, left blank
### Minor issues
* refs should have a certain name while pointing to sections with other names
* could be useful to have an acronym table
