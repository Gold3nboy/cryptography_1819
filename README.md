# PLEASE READ ME, before anything else
This repo contains some notes taken for the Cryptography course by me,
[blazef104](https://github.com/blazef104)
and [project2100](https://github.com/Project2100).


Please note that these notes are **our personal interpretation** of what the
professor said / what we were able to write during lectures , so they
could be full of potential errors.
**Don't take this as the Holy Bible**.
Instead, you can actively participate to this project, proposing changes and
making pull-requests.

I put notes here both for helping you and for improving them, so everyone can
enjoy crypto :-)

## How to participate

For improving/modifying something or **joining our group** you can contact me/us
directly (here, in class, over Telegram or via mail), or you can directly open a
pull request (and do it yourself). Since time is limited and it's very painful
to be paired with lectures, I would appreciate if you group together as much
changes as you can, you talk with us and then we decide when and how to manage
modifications (maybe in the weekend). 

## Latex 
Notes are written in Latex. 
**Since I'm not a Latex pro**, there could be __horrible things__ typed over there.
If you don't like something, change it directly or tell me and wait, or close
your eyes and try to forgive me.

The macro.tex file is taken from [asmeikal's page](https://github.com/asmeikal/crypto16/tree/master/notes) (thanks Michele for this).

### Notes schema
As you can see, I tried to split arguments __lesson by lesson__ (because these are
not lectures, but **lessons of life**), merging together arguments explained over 
different lectures for the sake of clarity.
I tried also to be as accurate as possible in drawing pictures.

If you don't like something/everything/life, please contact me so we can try to improve (at least notes).

### Major issues
* properly numbering chapters , section and subsections
* pairing theorems/claims/facts/exercises with Proofs unequivocally
### Minor issues
* refs should have a certain name while pointing to sections with other names
* could be useful to have an acronym table
