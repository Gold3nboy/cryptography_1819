\section{Message Authentication Codes and unforgeability}

After having explored the security conerns and challenges of the \ske{} realm, it is time to turn the attention to symmetric \mac{} schemes. Recall that a \mac{} scheme is a couple $(\textit{Tag}, \textit{Verify})$, with the purpose of auhenticating the message's source. In this chapter, the tagging function will be denoted as $\textit{Tag}_k$, akin to a \prf.

The desirable property that a \mac{} scheme should hold is to prevent any attacker from generating a valid couple $(m^*, \phi^*)$, even after querying a tagging oracle polynomially many times\footnotemark. The act of generating a valid couple from scratch is called \emph{forging}, and the aforementioned propery is defined as \emph{unforgeability against chosen-message attacks} (or \ufcma, in short); its game diagram is shown in figure \ref{cryptogame:ufcma}. Do note that $m^*$ is stated to be outside the query set $M$, justifying the ``freshness'' of the forged couple. In formal terms:

\footnotetext{Do note how this property resembles \cpa-security in the encryption setting}

\begin{definition}
    A \textsc{mac} scheme $\Pi$ is \textsc{ufcma}-secure iff:
    \[
        \forall\; \ppt\; \adversary\; \implies \Pr[\cryptog{ufcma}(\lambda) = 1] \in \negl{\lambda}  
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{cryptogame}
    {ufcma}
    {$\cryptog{ufcma}(\lambda)$}
    {ufcma}

    \cseqchallenger{$k \pickUAR \K$}

    \cseqbeginloop
    \send{}{$m_i \in M$}{}
    \receive{$\phi_i = Tag_k(m_i)$}{$\phi_i$}{}
    \cseqendloop
    
    \cseqdelay

    \send{$m^* \notin M$}{$(m^*, \phi^*)$}{\textsc{Output 1 iff} $Tag_k(m^*) = \phi^*$}
    
\end{cryptogame}

Having defined a good notion of security in the \mac{} scheme domain, we turn our attention to a somewhat trivial scheme, and find out that it is indeed secure:

\begin{theorem}
    Let $\Pi$ be a \mac{} scheme such that $\textit{Tag}_k = \textit{Verify}_k = F_k$, where $F_k$ is a \prf. Then $\Pi$ is \ufcma-secure.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The usual proof by randomic hybridization entails. The original game is identical to the \ufcma{} game, where the tagging function is the \prf, whereas the hybrid game will have it replaced with a truly random function, as shown in figure \ref{cryptogame:prfufcmahyb}.

    \begin{cryptogame}
        {prfufcmahyb}
        {$\hybridg{1}(\lambda)$}
        {}

        \cseqchallenger{$R \pickUAR \R(\lambda, n, l)$}

        \cseqbeginloop
        \send{}{$m_i \in M$}{}
        \receive{$\phi_i = R(m_i)$}{$\phi_i$}{}
        \cseqendloop

        \cseqdelay

        \send{$m^* \notin M$}{$(m^*, \phi^*)$}{\textsc{Output 1 iff} $\textit{Tag}_k(m^*) = \phi^*$}

    \end{cryptogame}

    \begin{lemma}
        $\cryptog{ufcma}(\lambda) \compindist \hybridg{1}(\lambda)$  
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{proof}
        By assuming there is a distinguisher $\distinguisher^{\ufcma}$ capable of disproving the lemma, it can be used to distinguish the \prf{} itself, as depicted by the reduction in figure \ref{cryptoredux:prfufcma}
    \end{proof}

        }{$b'$}{\textsc{Output 1 iff} $b' = b$}

    \begin{lemma}
        $\forall\; \ppt\; \adversary \implies \Pr[\hybridg{1}(\lambda) = 1] \leq 2^{-l}$
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{proof}
        This is true because attacker has to predict the output $R(m^*)$ on a fresh input $m^*$ to win the game, which can happen at most with probability $2^{-l}$.
    \end{proof}

    Thus, the conclusion is that $\Pi$ is \ufcma-secure.
\end{proof}

\section{Domain extension}

The previous scheme works on fixed length messages; as in the encryption domain, there are techinques for tagging variable length messages which are \ufcma-secure. However, before showing them, some other apparently secure modes are described here to give some possible insights on how to tackle the problem. 

Assume the message $m = (m_1, \dots, m_t) \in \{0,1\}^{n\cdot t}$ for some $t \geq 1$. Given the tagging function $\textit{Tag}_{k} : \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^l$, an attempt to tag the whole message may be to:

\begin{itemize}    
    \item \textsc{xor} all the message blocks, and then tag: $\phi = \textit{Tag}_k(\bigxor_{i=1}^{t} m_i)$. But then, given an authenticated message $(m, \phi)$, an adversary can always forge a valid couple $(m', \phi)$, where $m'$ is the original message with two flipped bits in two distinct blocks at the same offset; the resulting \textsc{xor} would be the same.

    \item define the tag to be a $t$-sequence of tags, one for each message block. Hovever, an adversary can just flip the position of two arbitrary distinct message blocks and their relative tags, and would succesfully forge a distinct authenticated message.

    \item attempt a variant of the above approach, by adding the block number to the block itself to avoid the previous forging. Again, this is not \ufcma-secure: the adversary may just make two queries on two distinct messages, obtain the two tag sequences, and then forge an authenticated message by choosing at each position $i$ whether to pick the message-tag blocks from the first or second query.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Collision-resistant hash functions}

A devised solution which has been proven to be secure relies on the following definition: a function family $\H$ which can be used to ``shrink'' variable length messages and then composed with a \prf{}:
\[
   \H = \{h_s : \{0, 1\}^{n\cdot t} \to \{0, 1\}^n \}_{s \in \{0, 1\}^\lambda}
\]
\[
   \textit{Tag}_{k, s}(m) = F_k(h_s(m))
\]

So what are the properties of the induced family $\F(\H) = \{F_{k}(h_{s}(.))\}$? The main problem are \emph{collisions}, since for each $m \in \{0,v1\}^{n\cdot t}$ it should be hard to find $m' \neq m$ such that $h_s(m) = h_s(m')$. But collisions do exist for functions in $\F(\H)$, because they map elements from $\{0, 1\}^{n\cdot t} $ to $\{0,1\}^t$, and since the codomain is smaller than the domain, the functions cannot be injective in any way.

To overcome this problem, we can consider two options:
\begin{itemize}
    \item assume collisions are hard to find given $s \in \{0,1\}^{\lambda}$ publicly, and we have a \textit{collision resistant hashing};
    \item let $s$ be secret, and assume collisions are hard to find because it is hard to know how $h_{s}$ works.
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}
    A function family $\H$ is deemed \emph{$\varepsilon$-universal} iff:
    \[
        \forall x \neq x' \in \{0, 1\}^{n\cdot t} \implies \Pr_{s \pickUAR \{0, 1\}^\lambda}[h_s(x) = h_s(x') ] \leq \epsilon  
    \]
\end{definition}

If $\epsilon = 2^{-n}$, meaning the collision probability is minimized, then the family is also called \emph{perfectly universal}; in the case where $\epsilon \in \negl{\lambda}$ isntead, it is defined as \emph{almost universal} (\textsc{au}).

\begin{lemma}
    Show that any pairwise independent hash function is perfectly universal.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} The proof is left as exercise.
    % AP190108: Leaving this part as-is
    (should I use $Col$ for solving this? What is the difference and when I should use $Col$ instead of one-shot-probability?) \textbf{ASK FOR SOLVING PROPERLY} (Thoughts: when I ask \textit{what's the probability that, chosen 2 distinct x-es, their hashes are the same \textbf{on a certain value}?}, maybe I have to use one-shot, because one-shot refers to the prob. that the two inputs collide on a specific value, even if not specified.

    Instead, if I consider \textit{what's the prob. that , chosen 2 distinct x-es, their hashes are the same?}, maybe I have to calculate all the possible collisions, because I want to know if the 2 inputs can collide in general. )
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    Assuming $\F$ is a \prf{} with $n$-bit domain and $\H$ is \textsc{au}, then $\F' = \F(\H)$ is a \prf{} on $(n\cdot t)-$ bit domain, for $t \geq 1$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

    This proof too will proceed by hybridizing the original game up to the ideal random one. Consider the three sequences depicted in figures \ref{cryptogame:prfaureal}, \ref{cryptogame:prfauhyb} and \ref{cryptogame:prfaurand}:

    \begin{cryptogame}
        {prfaureal}
        {$Real_{\F, \A}(\lambda)$}
        {}

        \cseqchallenger{\shortstack[l]{
            $k \pickUAR \{0, 1\}^\lambda$ \\
            $s \pickUAR \{0, 1\}^\lambda$
        }}

        \cseqbeginloop
        \send{}{$x$}{}
        \receive{$y = F_k(h_s(x))$}{$y$}{}
        \cseqendloop
        
    \end{cryptogame}

    \begin{cryptogame}
        {prfauhyb}
        {$\H\Y\B_{\R, \A}(\lambda)$}
        {}

        \cseqchallenger{\shortstack[l]{
            $\overline{R} \pickUAR \R(\lambda, n, l)$ \\
            $s \pickUAR \{0, 1\}^\lambda$
        }}

        \cseqbeginloop
        \send{}{$x$}{}
        \receive{$y = \overline{R}(h_s(x))$}{$y$}{}
        \cseqendloop
        
    \end{cryptogame}

    \begin{cryptogame}
        {prfaurand}
        {$Rand_{\R', \A}(\lambda)$}
        {}

        \cseqchallenger{$R \pickUAR \R(\lambda, n, l)$}

        \cseqbeginloop
        \send{}{$x$}{}
        \receive{$y = R(x)$}{$y$}{}
        \cseqendloop
        
    \end{cryptogame}


    \begin{lemma}
        \[
            Real_{\F, \A}(\lambda) \compindist \H\Y\B_{\R, \A}(\lambda)
        \]
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{proof}
        The proof is left as exercise.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        \[
            \H\Y\B_{\R, \A}(\lambda) \compindist Rand_{\R', \A}(\lambda)
        \]
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{proof}

        Again, collisions come into play there, but in a much sneakier way. Given two queries with arguments $x_1, x_2$ returning the same image $y$, the random game can model two scenarios:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item the arguments are equal, but with negligible probability
            \item the arguments are distinct
        \end{itemize}

        while the hybrid can model three of them:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item the arguments are equal, again with negligible probability
            \item the arguments are distinct, \emph{and so are their hashes}
            \item the arguments are distinct, \emph{but not their hashes}
        \end{itemize}
    
        We want to show that the collision at hash level is negligible: as long as they don't happen, the random function $\overline{R}$ is run over a sequence of distinct points, and behaves just as the random game's function $R$ does. So let \textsc{bad} be the event:
        \[
            \exists i \neq j \in [q] : h_s(x_i) = h_s(x_j)
        \]
        where $q$ denotes the adversary's query count. It suffices to show that $\Pr[\textsc{Bad}] \in \negl{\lambda}$.

        % AP190108: Copied verbatim from my notes, maybe this is something Venturi wrote. Doesn't mean I fully understand it...
        Since we don't care what happens after a collision, we can alternatively consider a mental experiment where we answer all queries at random, and only at the end sample $s \pickUAR \{0, 1\}^\lambda$ and check ofr collisions: this does not change the value of $\Pr(\textsc{Bad})$. Now queries are independent of $s$, and this eases our proof:
        \begin{align*}
            \Pr[\textsc{Bad}] &= \Pr_s [\exists x_i \neq x_j, h_s(x_i) = h_s(x_j)] &\\
            &\leq \sum_{i \neq j} \Pr_s [h_s(x_i) = h_s(x_j)] & h_s \text{ is \textsc{au} by definition} \\
            &\leq {q \choose 2} \negl{\lambda} \in \negl{\lambda} &
        \end{align*}

        By ruling out this event, the lemma is proven.
    \end{proof}

     So now we have $Real \compindist \H\Y\B \compindist Rand$
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    Let $\Pi = (\textit{Tag}, \textit{Verify})$ be a variable length message \mac{} scheme where, given a \prf{} $F_k$ and an \textsc{au} hash funcion family $h_s$, the tagging function is defined as $F_k(h_s)$. Then $\Pi$ is \ufcma-secure.
\end{corollary}

\subsection{$\H$ family using Galois Fields}
Now we want to show a possible shrinking/hash function which can be used in a
UFCMA-secure MAC.

\begin{construction}
    Take $ \mathbb{F}=GF(2^{n})$, a \textit{Galois field} of $2^{n}$
    elements.\\
    Let $m=(m_{1}, ..., m_{t}) \in \mathbb{F}^{t} $ and $s=(s_{1}, ...,
    s_{t}) \in \mathbb{F}^{t} $. We state that 
    \[
        h_{s}(m)= \sum_{i=1}^{t}s_{i}m_{i}=<s,m>=q_{m}(s)
       \]
\end{construction}

A generic \textit{galois field} has very interesting properties, like the
following :
\begin{itemize}
    \item addition of two elements is like applying the XOR operation on their
        binary forms;
    \item multiplication of two elements is like the product $mod 2^{n}$
\end{itemize}.
Now, since this family must be almost universal to be used as part of
UFCMA-secure MAC protocol, collisions must happen a negligible amount of
time.\\
Suppose we have a collision with two different messages:
\[
     \sum_{i=1}^{t} m_{i}s_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{t} m'_{i}s_{i}
\]
Let $\delta_{i}=m_{i}-m'_{i}$, assuming  without loss of generality that
$\delta \not= 0$.\\
Now we have that, when a collision happens, 
\begin{gather*}
    \sum_{i=1}^{t} m_{i}s_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{t} m'_{i}s_{i}\Leftrightarrow \\
    \sum_{i=1}^{t} m_{i}s_{i}-\sum_{i=1}^{t} m'_{i}s_{i}=0 \Leftrightarrow \\
    \sum_{i=1}^{t} \delta_{i}s_{i}=0 
\end{gather*}

Taking $m, m'$ such that $m \not= m'$ means that $m$ is distinct from $m'$ at least for one subsequence $m_{i}\not=m'_{i}$.

So we can assume, without loss of generality, that $i=1$ is an index (or the only index) which $m$ and $m'$ differ on.

So we can split the last summation in 2 parts, choosing $\delta_{1}s_{1}$ as the first element and $ \sum_{i=2}^{t} \delta_{i}s_{i}$ as second element:

\begin{gather*}
    \delta_{1}s_{1}+\sum_{i=2}^{t} \delta_{i}s_{i}=0 \Leftrightarrow \\
    \delta_{1}s_{1}=-\sum_{i=2}^{t} \delta_{i}s_{i} \Leftrightarrow \\
    s_{1}=\frac{-\sum_{i=2}^{t} \delta_{i}s_{i}}{\delta_{1}}
\end{gather*}

and this means that when a collision happens $s_{1}$ must be exactly equal two the second member of the equation, which isan element of $\mathbb{F}$. But since every seed is chosen at random among $ \mathbb{F} $, what's the probability of picking the element $s_{1}$ which zeroes the above equation?

This probability is just $\frac{1}{ \mathbb{F} } = \frac{1}{2^{n}} \in \negl{\lambda} $.

\subsubsection{$\H$ with Galois fields elements and polynomials}

\begin{construction}
    Take $ \mathbb{F}=GF(2^{n})$, a \textit{Galois field} of $2^{n}$
    elements.\\
    Let $m=(m_{1}, ..., m_{t}) \in \mathbb{F}^{t} $ and $s \leftarrow\$ 
    \mathbb{F}^{t} $. We state that 
    \[
        h_{s}(m)= \sum_{i=1}^{t}s^{i-1}m_{i}
       \]
\end{construction}


\begin{exercise}
    Prove that this construction is \textbf{almost universal}.

    (possible proof: to be almost universal, looking at the definition, collisions with $m \not= m'$ must be negligible.

    So consider a collision as above: it must be true that  
    \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{t} m_{i}s^{i-1}=\sum_{i=1}^{t} m'_{i}s^{i-1} \Leftrightarrow 
     \sum_{i=1}^{t} m_{i}s^{i-1}-\sum_{i=1}^{t} m'_{i}s^{i-1}=0 \Leftrightarrow
     q_{m-m'}(s)=0
    \]
    How can we make a polynomial equal to 0? We have to find the \textbf{roots} of the polynomial, which we know are at most the \textbf{grade} of the polynomial. So, the grade of this polynomial is $t-1$, and the probability of picking a root from $ \mathbb{F} $ as seed of $h_{s}(.)$ is 
    \[
        \P [s=root]=\frac{t-1}{2^{n}}   \in \negl{\lambda} 
    \] )
\end{exercise}
