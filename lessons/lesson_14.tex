\subsection{Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption}

Claim: \ddh is not hard for groups $\integer_p^\times$

Proof: Let $Quad_p$ be the group of quadratic residues modulo $p$, group operation is multiplication.

We can test if a give number $y$ is in Quad by checking if $y^{(p-1)/2} \equiv_p 1$, because:
\[
    y = g^{2z} \implies y^{(p-1)/2} = g^{2z(p-1)/2} = g^{z(p-1)} \equiv_p 1
\]
Otherwise: % AP190208: Not sure at all that this is correct
\[
    y \neq g^{2z} \implies y^{(p-1)/2} \equiv_p g^{z'(p-1)} \cdot g^{(p-1)/2} \not\equiv_p 1
\]

Claim: $g^{xy} \in Quad_p \implies 2 | x \vee 2 | y$

???

Can have a distinguisher; end of Proof

Nevertheless, some otehr groups are believed to harden quadratic residue membership; such groups are $Quad_p$ itself, or the elliptic curve groups.

%-------------------------

Recall: DL is hard

Extend: $g^x, g^{y_1}, g^{xy_1}, g^{y_2}, g^{xy_2}, g^{y_3}, g^{xy_3}, \dots$

prove this is hard by hybrid arg

% CPA2 (for PKE schemes) - encryption queries are free, the game collapses into a receive(+1 for pk)-send sequence
